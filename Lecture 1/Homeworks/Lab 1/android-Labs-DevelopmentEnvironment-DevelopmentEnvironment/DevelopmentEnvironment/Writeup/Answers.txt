a. 
  Before line 94, mathResult did not exist. At line 94 mathResult is set to `result.getText().toString(). After line 94, mathResult has a value of "96".
b.
  Since SimpleCalc does not allow the creation of negative numbers so NUMBER_NEG_22 actually is only 22. Since we added the values together 22 and 74 give 96. The intention was to try and get 52 but due to the limitations of SimpleCalc, that was not accomplished. Whether or not the value is a correct value depends on one's interpretation of whether correct is having the answer match the intended answer or correct is the function properly executing what it is supposed to do. Since SimpleCalc only saw 22 and not -22 one can argue that SimpleCalc is correct in show ing a result of 96.
